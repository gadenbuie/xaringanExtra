# xaringanExtra 0.0.18 (2020-07-16)

* Improved accessibility of panelset so that it now works with touch devices.
  The currently selected tab is written into the URL query to ensure that URLs
  resolve to currently open tab. The tab ID isn't written into the URL hash
  because this is used by remarkjs to jump to the current slide. (#34, #33, #18)

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# xaringanExtra 0.0.17 (2020-07-09)

* [_Your slides are so extra!_ (useR!2020)](https://youtu.be/vZMuu77ocMY)

* `text_poster()` has been deprecated and will be removed eventually.
