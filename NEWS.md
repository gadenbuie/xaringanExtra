# xaringanExtra (development version)

# xaringanExtra 0.7.0

* BREAKING CHANGE: All arguments to `use_banner()` must be named. `use_banner()`
  now takes `...` earlier since you may want to include `style_banner()` style
  arguments without having to specify all the other arguments (#169).
  
* **scribble** can now be disabled on an individual slide by adding
  `class: no-scribble` to the slide (@mattwarkentin #166).

* Embedding slides via `embed_xaringan()` no longer requires that you set
  `self_contained: false` in the R Markdown document. `embed_xaringan()` now
  automatically sets the `data-external="1"` attribute on the element embedding
  the xaringan slides (thanks @jhelvy, @drfurtado, #177).

* **editable** now hides remark's "Paused" overlay when editing slides in
  presenter mode (#178).
  
# xaringanExtra 0.6.0 (2022-06-07)

* First release available on CRAN! Read about it at [garrickadenbuie.com/blog/xaringanextra-v0.6.0/](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/xaringanextra-v0.6.0/).

## New extras

* Add banners to your slides with `use_banner()`. Banners are text (or other
  HTML) that appear on every slide, for example the title of your talk or a link
  to your slides online. (thanks @mattwarkentin and @dataning, #161)
  
## Improved extras
  
* Sideways panelsets collapse to standard panelsets with tabs above the content
  on small devices (max-width 480px). (#122)

* Keep sideways panelset tabs on screen with long-scrolling content. (#123)

* The `panelset=TRUE` chunk option now automatically sets `results="hold"`
  unless over-ridden by a local chunk option.

## Fixed extras

* _share again_ no longer shows when viewing slides in the RStudio viewer pane. (#128)

* `use_xaringan_extras("panelset")` is now equivalent to `use_panelset()`.
  Previously the first would not install the knitr chunk hooks.
  
* panelset now uses the xaringan knitr source hooks, restoring line highlighting
  in the source panel of panelset chunks. (#138)

* Hide scribble controls when printing slides (thanks @yyzeng, #136).

* `text_poster()` has been removed.


# xaringanExtra 0.5.0 (2021-06-13)

* Added _sideways_ panelsets where tabs appear on the left or right side next
  to the tabbed content. [Learn more about this feature](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset?id=sideways-panelsets). (#121)

# xaringanExtra 0.4.2 (2021-05-29)

* Added color presets to **scribble**: press `0` through `9` while drawing to
  quickly toggle through a preset color palette, customizable using the
  `palette` argument of `use_palette()` (thanks @kim-soo-hwan, #112, #117).
  
* New feature: animated progress bars that don't interfere with the slide
  number. Simply add `use_progress_bar()` to your slides! (#109, #118)

# xaringanExtra 0.4.0 (2021-03-27)

* New extension: Always play gifs from the start with `use_freezeframe()` (#102)

# xaringanExtra 0.3.1 (2021-03-13)

* **Breaking change:** scribble now only accepts hexadecimal pen colors. You
  can still use `rgb()` syntax by calling the `rgb()` function in R: instead of
  `"rgb(61, 255, 232)"`, you can write `rgb(61, 255, 232, maxColorValue = 255)`.
* Fix a few other minor issues with **scribble**:
    - Fix toolbox unminimizing after mouseover when it should stay minimized
    - Don't show the eraser cursor until the mouse moves

# xaringanExtra 0.3.0 (2021-03-07)

- New addin: **scribble**! Now you can draw on your slides! Huge thanks to
  @mattwarkentin for developing and contributing this extension. With
  `use_scribble()` you can draw on your slides using your mouse or a tablet with
  stylus. Drawings stay with each slide and scale when the slides are resized.
  You can erase individual lines, undo or redo with keyboard shortcuts, or clear
  the drawings on the current slide easily with the provided toolbox.
  Thanks also to @LauraRK and @rpruim for suggestions and feedback.
  (@mattwarkentin #87)

# xaringanExtra 0.2.6 (2021-03-02)

- New addin: **search**! Easily search through the text in your slides.
  (thanks @statnmap, #82)
  
- All extensions now use version numbers that are independent of the
  xaringanExtra package version. This will reduce the number of copies of an
  extension that are added to a blogdown site's dependencies by ensuring that
  unrelated package updates don't change the extension version number.

# xaringanExtra 0.2.5 (2021-02-17)

- Resizing the tiles in Tile View now works when using browser zoom in/out

# xaringanExtra 0.2.4 (2020-10-21)

- Added **panelset chunks** that output code chunks source and results in 
  separate panel tabs (#59)
  
- Added **broadcast**, a new experimental extension that allows viewers to follow the
  presenter's slides in their own browsers (thanks @spcanelon, #51, #58)
  
- Changing a panelset tab now emits a window resize event in hopes that any
  HTMLwidgets contained in the panel will resize to fit the panel container
  (thanks @mfherman #64)

# xaringanExtra 0.2.3 (2020-09-03)

## New Features

- **Panelset** now works with the same markdown formatting as R Markdown's
  `.tabset` feature in R Markdown documents! See
  [the panelset documentation](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/#/panelset)
  for more information and examples (#41).

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with URL updating and **panelset** that caused security warnings
  in Safari and led to temporarily broken slide navigation (thanks @jvcasillas, #50)

# xaringanExtra 0.2.2 (2020-09-02)

- Fixed several issues with `style_share_again()`: fixed default arguments,
  the buttons now correctly inherit the foreground color, and slides without an
  author or title are handled correctly (thanks @mattwarkentin, #48).

# xaringanExtra 0.2.1 (2020-08-23)

- Use absolute units for share bar sizes and fix a typo in share bar hover text
  (thanks @apreshill, #44)

# xaringanExtra 0.2.0 (2020-08-22)

## New Features

- Added a new extension for sharing your slides called _share again_. It adds a
  "share bar" to the bottom of your slides when embedded in an `<iframe`> in
  another page. Another function `embed_xaringan()` is provided to embed slides
  in blogdown and R Markdown HTML sites in a responsive container.
  
## Updates and Changes

* Various updates do `use_logo()` documentation. The class to hide the logo is
  `.hide_logo` and the logo CSS and JavaScript are embedded directly for
  xaringan >= 0.16 (thanks @chainsawriot, #22, #24, #25, #30)
  
* Updated cookie settings when storing editable fields (#42)

* Disabled spell check and auto complete in editable areas (#16)

# xaringanExtra 0.1.0 (2020-08-14)

## Breaking Changes

* The CSS variables for panelset have been renamed and the arguments of
  `style_panelset_tabs()` haven been updated for ease of use. Unfortunately, this
  change is not backwards compatible; using the previous argument names will
  result in an informative warning without throwing an error. The panelset
  also does a better job of handling many tabs, which are now wrapped into
  multiple lines of tabs. (thanks @realauggieheschmeyer, #37, #38, #39).
  
* In conjunction with the item above, the `style_panelset()` has been renamed
  `style_panelset_tabs()`. This more clearly describes the part of the panelset
  that is styled, and it helps clarify the meaning of the more concise function
  argument names.

# xaringanExtra 0.0.19 (2020-07-22)

* Increased specificity of CSS rules for the panelset.

* Added `--panel-tab-background-color` with additional `-active` and `-hover`
  custom properties to style the background color of tabs. Similarly, two
  CSS variables for border color were added: `--panel-tab-border-color-active`
  and `--panel-tab-border-color-hover`.

* Updated Tachyons to 4.12.0 (#27)

* Added **clipboard** extra with `use_clipboard()`. Adds a "Copy Code" button
  to code chunks (`<pre><code>...</code></pre>`) and works in both xaringan
  slides and R Markdown documents (thanks @mattwarkentin #20, #36).

# xaringanExtra 0.0.18 (2020-07-16)

* Improved accessibility of panelset so that it now works with touch devices.
  The currently selected tab is written into the URL query to ensure that URLs
  resolve to currently open tab. The tab ID isn't written into the URL hash
  because this is used by remarkjs to jump to the current slide. (#34, #33, #18)

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# xaringanExtra 0.0.17 (2020-07-09)

* [_Your slides are so extra!_ (useR!2020)](https://youtu.be/vZMuu77ocMY)

* `text_poster()` has been deprecated and will be removed eventually.
