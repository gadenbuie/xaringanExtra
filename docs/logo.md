## ðŸ’Œ Logo

#### ðŸ“º [Logo Demo](https://pkg.garrickadenbuie.com/xaringanExtra/logo/)

`use_logo()` adds a logo to all of your slides. You can make the logo a
clickable link and choose where on the slide it is placed. You can also
set which types of slides will not get the logo by default.

To add a logo to your xaringan presentation, add the following code
chunk to your slidesâ€™ R Markdown file.

```` markdown
```{r xaringan-logo, echo=FALSE}
xaringanExtra::use_logo(
  image_url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/hex-stickers/master/PNG/xaringan.png"
)
```
````

See the documentation for `?use_logo` for more options regarding sizing
and positioning. You can also make the logo a link using `link_url` and
you can hide the logo for a particular slide by using the `hide_logo`
slide class.
