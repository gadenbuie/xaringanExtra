\description{
The \emph{share again} extension helps you share your xaringan slides. Adding the
extension to your slides with \code{use_share_again()} enables a "share" bar that
only appears when your slides are embedded in a web page in an \verb{<iframe>}. To
embed your presentation in another page, like a blogdown post or a R Markdown
based site, use \code{embed_xaringan()}. This function adds your slides in a
responsive aspect ratio container that seamlessly includes your slides in
the page. Finally, for perfect looking slides, use \code{style_share_again()} to
style the share bar to match your slides' aesthetic. You can also use this
function to enable or disable specific social media sites and platforms from
the share menu.
